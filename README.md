## Objectivity Data Engineer short task

### Introduction
As a part of the Data Engineer recruitment process, we've wanted to present you a small bit
of Data Engineer work, as well as get to know your skills a little better.


### Task

The task is simple, and shouldn't take more than 10 minutes of your work.

1. Fill in the function that's supposed to read numbers.csv file content from filedir,
2. Write your function that's going to execute calculate_numbers function faster than the basic
implementation in basic_logic_implementation,
3. That's it, if only your code works (and the one and only test passes), please add your solution
to the CV which you'll send with the application. (Best way will be link to your github with it)


### Tips
1. Make the solution work both on Windows and Linux (paths to CSV)
2. Please, don't modify methods: calculate_numbers, basic_logic_implementation or main.
3. Solution shall work under Python 3.5 and later.
